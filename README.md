# NewsSearch

This is my first ever attemt at making an API, this apecific API scans the a href tags in diffrent sites and searches for a specific keyword in the title and gives back the title and the url of articles with that keywork in Json. 

To view it nicely, Download the Json viewer extension in your browser, <a href= "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-viewer/gbmdgpbipfallnflgajpaliibnhdgobh/related">JSON viewer</a>.
